I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel HIll in the [Yun Li Lab](https://yunliweb.its.unc.edu). My research is supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program](http://nsfgrfp.org). The goal of my research is to develop statistical methods to address health disparities in statistical genetics. Specifically, I am interested in methods which extend summary statitsic-based approaches relying on LD reference panels to admixed populations. 

So far in my graduate career, I have developed THUNDER, a deconvolution method for bulk Hi-C data to infer cell type proportions and cell-type specific interaction profiles. Additionally, I am the lead statistician on our lab's transcriptome wide association study (TWAS) of blood cell traits in the UK Biobank. 

I graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 2017 with a B.S. in Mathematics. At Centre, I was awared the [Brown Fellows Scholarship](https://www.centre.edu/brown-fellows/), a "full ride plus" scholarship which promotes experiential learning and ambassadorship through self-designed summer enrichment experiences and Kentucky connection trips.
